# Addressbook
Probably my best example yet.
It absolutely surpassed all my expectations with flying colors.

This example is an addressbook you can use to store information about people.
It's implemented quite abstract, so you can easily change it into something else.

This is the basic window:\

(And yes, after hyperfocused programming for 2 hours, I switched up "age" with "name" in some cases. That's politics for you.)

# Features
## Basic
Select an entry on the left and edit it through the input-elements on the right.

Press `submit` or `enter`(-key) to save the changes.

Create a new entry by pressing `new`. Delete the selected one pressing `Delete`.

## Popups
The most interesting feature about this.

When double-clicking a table-row, or clicking `Pin`, the entry opens in a small, separate window:\
![](../../assets/images/2025-11-23-21-00-30.png)

Of course, you can open multiple at once.
These windows stay on top, so it's like pinning a note to your screen.
Perfect for forgetful people like me:\

The best part is that you can edit the data in these popups too, which synchronizes with the main table.

Also, note that the small popups close when they should, like when their entry gets deleted, or when the same entry is pinned again.

## Searchbar
The input on top is a searchbar.
Type in a text and only rows containing that text remain visible.

Actually, only one column is searched.
Select which column that should be using the combobox next to the searchbar:\
![](../../assets/images/2025-11-23-21-10-02.png)\
![](../../assets/images/2025-11-23-21-10-22.png)

Pressing `clear` clears the searchbar.

## Configurability
The backend is quite configurable.

For example, you can easily change which columns to use:\

Also, the whole gui is implemented as a non-blocking popup.
You could easily integrate it into an existing application.

# Demonstrated concepts
- Dynamic creation of layouts
- `sg.Table`
    - Dynamic usage of table-rows
    - Filter-functionality
- Non-blocking popups
  - "Stacking" popups
- Using a popup as the main window
