# Examples

An example is a concrete application of SwiftGUI.

Examples are divided into categories:
- Simple: You just got started using SwiftGUI and have a basic knowledge of Python
- Intermediate: You have read all the basic tutorials of this documentation
- Advanced: You have some experience in using SwiftGUI and Python
- Expert: Anything above "advanced". Pushes the boundaries of SwiftGUI

These categories are less about how advanced the subjects are, but how complicated the script is.\
Simple examples are easy to understand, intermediate ones are a bit more complicated.

When an interesting question is asked in the forums (issues/discussions), I might use that opportunity to write an example just for that application.
