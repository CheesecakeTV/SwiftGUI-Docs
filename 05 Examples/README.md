# Examples

An example is a concrete application of SwiftGUI.

Examples are divided into categories:
- Simple: You just got started using SwiftGUI and have a basic knowledge of Python
- Intermediate: You have read all the basic tutorials and are familliar with their concepts
- Advanced: You have some experience in using SwiftGUI and a solid understanding of the Python language
- Expert: Anything above "advanced". Really tries pushing the boundaries of SwiftGUI

When an interesting question is asked in the forums (issues/discussions), I might use that opportunity to write an example just for that application.
