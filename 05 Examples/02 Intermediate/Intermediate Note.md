# Intermediate note
This simple program lets you create and edit notes.

Write something in the note, when you close the window, it gets saved.

I will publish an example of this program in every "difficulty-level".

This one is "intermediate", because it's quite a lot of code.

In contrast to the simple version, this version lets you manage multiple notes, create new ones, etc.
