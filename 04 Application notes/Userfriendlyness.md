# Userfriendlyness
I know, SwiftGUI's GUIs can look pretty outdated.
But for me personally, that's not an issue.

As long as it doesn't look terrible, my sole focus is on the userfriendlyness.

Userfriendlyness transforms a good program into a great one.
On the other side, bad userfriendlyness makes even the best programs feel very bad.

A good example for this is LTSpice, a circuit simulator.
The simulations are amazing, but I hate to use it.
It has the worst user-friendlyness of any program I know.

# Use your program and be petty about it
Your program shouldn't annoy the user, ideally at all.

Sure, going through 2 popups to reach your desired functionality might make for a nicer code, but the user doesn't look at the code.

Use your own program a lot.
Improve everything that doesn't feel natural to you.
Improve everything that is slowing you down unnecessarely.

Yes, something very small is only a tiny bit annoying, but trust me, the user is gonna notice.

Remove every tiny annoyance you find.

# Working with the focus

# Layout considerations
## Mouse-movement-distances and hotkeys

## Accessability vs tidyness

## Visual separation of functionalities 

## Descriptive texts

# Getting feedback from other people
